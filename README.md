## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, communication is key. This project leverages SMS, one of the most ubiquitous forms of communication, to provide a chat service that responds to user queries using the power of AI. By integrating the ChatGPT API, this service can understand and generate human-like text responses, making it an effective tool for various applications, such as customer support, information dissemination, and more.

##Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for developing the server-side application.
Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used for handling HTTP requests and responses.
Twilio: A cloud communications platform used to send and receive SMS messages.
Ngrok: A tool that exposes local servers to the internet, used here to make the local Flask server accessible remotely for testing.
ChatGPT API: An API provided by OpenAI to generate AI-powered responses to user queries.
Project Structure
The project consists of a Flask application that interacts with the Twilio API to send and receive SMS messages. Incoming SMS messages are processed by the Flask server, which then uses the ChatGPT API to generate a response. The response is sent back to the user via Twilio.

##Features
Send SMS: Send SMS messages using the Twilio API.
Receive SMS: Receive SMS messages and process them using Flask.
Automated Responses: Generate automated responses to incoming SMS messages using the ChatGPT API.
Ngrok Integration: Expose the local Flask server to the internet using Ngrok for remote access and testing.

## Configuration

1. **Twilio Setup:**
   - Sign up for a Twilio account and get your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number.
   - Add your phone number in the Twilio Console and configure the messaging webhook to use Ngrok URL (which will be set up later).

2. **ChatGPT API Setup:**
   - Sign up for an OpenAI account and get your API key.

3. **Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your credentials:**

   ```bash
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start Ngrok to expose your local server:**

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

3. **Update Twilio Webhook:**
   - In the Twilio Console, navigate to your phone number settings.
   - Set the **Messaging** webhook to the Ngrok URL provided, appending `/sms` (e.g., `http://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/sms`).
